# Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge

## Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. In this challenge, we aim to build a predictive model that answers the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (e.g., name, age, gender, socio-economic class).

## Project Structure
This repository contains the code and resources used to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers.

### Files
- `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, model building, and evaluation process.
- `train.csv`: The training dataset provided by the competition, containing features and the ground truth labels for survival.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset provided by the competition, containing similar features but without the ground truth labels for survival.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

### Datasets
- **train.csv**: Contains the details of 891 passengers on board and reveals whether they survived or not.
- **test.csv**: Contains details of 418 passengers on board but does not disclose whether they survived.
